Official [CKEditor 5](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/) common integration utils. This package contains a set of utilities that are shared between CKEditor 5 framework integrations such like:

- [CKEditor 5 Vue integration](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue)
- [CKEditor 5 React integration](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-react)
- [CKEditor 5 Angular integration](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-angular)

The prime example of such shared utility might be the CKEditor 5 Cloud integration loader that is used by all integrations to dynamically load the editor from the CDN.

It's highly recommended to not use this package directly in your application because it's intended to be used by through the integrations listed above. However, if you need to use it directly (because you are using framework that is not supported by the integrations), you can use it as a standalone package, but keep in mind that the API is designed to be used by the integrations and might not be user-friendly.

## Releasing package

CircleCI automates the release process and can release both channels: stable (`X.Y.Z`) and pre-releases (`X.Y.Z-alpha.X`, etc.).

Before you start, you need to prepare the changelog entries.

1. Make sure the `#master` branch is up-to-date: `git fetch && git checkout master && git pull`.
1. Prepare a release branch: `git checkout -b release-[YYYYMMDD]` where `YYYYMMDD` is the current day.
1. Generate the changelog entries: `pnpm run release:prepare-changelog`.
	* You can specify the release date by passing the `--date` option, e.g., `--date=2025-06-11`.
	* By passing the `--dry-run` option, you can check what the script will do without actually modifying the files.
	* Read all the entries, correct poor wording and other issues, wrap code names in backticks to format them, etc.
	* Add the missing `the/a` articles, `()` to method names, "it's" -> "its", etc.
	* A newly introduced feature should have just one changelog entry – something like "The initial implementation of the FOO feature." with a description of what it does.
1. Commit all changes and prepare a new pull request targeting the `#master` branch.
1. Ping the `@ckeditor/ckeditor-5-platform` team to review the pull request and trigger the release process.
