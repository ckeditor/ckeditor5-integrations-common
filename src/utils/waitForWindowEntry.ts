/**
 * Waits for the provided window entry to be available. It's used mostly for waiting for the CKEditor 5 window object to be available.
 * In theory these entries should be available immediately, but in practice, they might be loaded asynchronously because browser might
 * delay execution of the script even if it's loaded synchronously.
 *
 * Function ensures that proper type declarations are present on global Window interface.
 *
 * @param entryNames The names of the window entries to wait for.
 * @param config Configuration for the function.
 * @returns A promise that resolves when the window entry is available.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const ckeditor = await waitForWindowEntry( [ 'CKEditor' ] );
 * ```
